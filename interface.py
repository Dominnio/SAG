#===============================SUMMARY===================================
#
#   The agent system performs task of a distributed image classification.
#   System consists of agents that are communicating asynchronously. The decision
#   of the classifier is obtained by voting. A randomly selected commanding agent 
#   from ordinary agents is responsible for outsourcing tasks and collecting
#   classification results. System ensures operation even if contact with some
#   agents is lost.
